This is a sample document for testing the RAG AI Assistant.
It contains some basic information that can be used to test the question-answering functionality.

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system works by:
1. Retrieving relevant documents based on the user's question
2. Using the retrieved documents as context
3. Generating an answer using the Gemini AI model

This system can be used to answer questions about any documents that are added to the system.
